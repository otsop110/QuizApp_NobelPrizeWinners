# QuizApp_NobelPrizeWinners

This is Udacity Android Development for Beginners Nanodegree Project number 3.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills that have been practiced throughout the course. They include:

* Planning your app design before coding.
* Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
* Creating, positioning, and styling views.
* Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
* Commenting and documenting your code.

## Project requirements

* Building the layout. This involves creating the quiz questions, deciding what type of quiz they will be, and formatting them in the xml layout file for your Activity.
* Writing readable code that links the layout to the activity. 
* Creating variables that refer to each of the quiz answers.
* Writing the functional code for the button which checks your answers. This code runs through each question in the app, record whether the user got the question right, and then display the quiz results in a Toast message.
* The app includes at least four of the following Views: TextView, ImageView, Button, Checkbox, EditText, LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, ScrollView, RadioButton, RadioGroup.
* The code adheres to all of the following best practices: Text sizes are defined in sp, Lengths are defined in dp, Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
* The app contains at least one if/else statement
